  "FONG_SCORE_PROSTATE_INFO_1": "The Fong Clinical Risk Score is a prognostic tool designed to assess the prognosis for patients who benefit from undergoing resection of hepatic metastases in colorectal cancer. Long-term outcome can be predicted from five criteria that are readily available for all patients considered for resection: node-positive primary tumour, time from diagnosis of primary tumor to development of liver metastases <12 months, number of liver metastases >1, size of largest liver metastases >5 cm, and pre-operative carcinoembryonic antigen level [3]. This scoring system is used to predict the survival outcome after resection of liver metastases and may help determine the role of perioperative systemic therapy, the need for further imaging and clinical trial selection.",
  "FONG_SCORE_PROSTATE_INFO_2": "The score was initially developed in the 1990 s and survival outcomes in more modern cohorts have been published and are displayed above and in the results section of this tool. These contemporary analyses include 502 patients treated in Johns Hopkins Hospital USA, between January 2000 and December 2015 [Margonis et al] and 1,105 patients treated in the Netherlands who were diagnosed between January 2015 and December 2016 with data extracted from the Netherlands Cancer Registry [Bolhuis et al] [1] [2].",
